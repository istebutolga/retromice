Atelier 801 SARL Privacy Policy


Thank you for visiting our website (the "Website"). Atelier 801 SARL (Publisher and manager of Retromice) operates this Website and maintains this Privacy Policy ("Policy") that summarizes when and how your personal information is collected, used, safeguarded and disclosed in connection with your use of the Website.


We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the privacy policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.


What is personal information?


As used herein, the term "Personal Information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other account number), and information about that individual's location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Website, when directly linked to personally identifiable information.


Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Website or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Website. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.


What personal information do we collect?


Active Collection

Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Site. For example, we may collect your username and password and demographic information when you register and set up an account.


Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with creating a profile or group, leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user or participating in any interactive chat rooms, forums or features on the site.

Conversations on the Retromice “Chat” are not saved.


We only save your nickname and password and email address if you had given it when you registered.

You can access certain portion of our Website without providing us with any personal information. However, you will not be able to utilize certain features that require registration or receive materials unless certain information is provided. From time to time, we may change the information requested upon registration or with respect to certain features or services, so this may not be a complete list.


Log Files

When you use the Website, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring website, and your activity on the Website. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.


Cookies and Web Beacons

Do we share personal information?


Unless otherwise described elsewhere in this Policy, we generally do not disclose, sell or trade any personal information about our visitors and users to any third parties.


We may share personal information with vendors, consultants and other service providers (“Service Providers”) who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Website or the Services and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. In some cases, the Service Provider may be directly collecting the information from you on our behalf. We inform Service Providers that they are not permitted to use personal information they obtain from us other than to provide the services for us. However, we are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these Service Providers and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing any personal information directly to such Service Providers.


We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Atelier 801 SARL, our users, our employees, or the public, including without limitation to protect Atelier 801 SARL or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Website. Information we collect, including personal information, may also be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of the business assets of Atelier 801 SARL.


You understand that when you use the community features of our Website, information you post in public or private groups, forums, and other interactive areas of the Website, as well as any information you share with individuals through the Website, will be available to other users and in some cases (such as when you post to a public area of the Website) may be publicly available.

some of the personal information that we receive. These Service Providers are contractually required

to safeguard and secure the personal information they received from us. However, we are not

responsible or liable in any manner for the actions or inaction of any Service Providers.


Although we strive to protect your Personal Information, you should be aware that information sent over the Internet is not necessarily secure and may be intercepted or accessed by third-parties.
