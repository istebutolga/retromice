            <p>Thank you for visiting our website (the "Website"). Atelier 801 SARL (Publisher and manager of Retromice) operates this Website and maintains this Privacy Policy ("Policy") that summarizes when and how your personal information is collected, used, safeguarded and disclosed in connection with your use of the Website.</p>

            <h3>What is personal information?</h3>
            <p>As used herein, the term "Personal Information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other account number), and information about that individual's location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Website, when directly linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Website or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Website. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>
